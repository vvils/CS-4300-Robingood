Anderson observes an ""instant gratification"" scenario unfolding in REITs, noting their quick recovery despite the weaker state of the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX). He explains that ""any kind of investment vehicle with an income component like the REITs"" tends to thrive in a declining rate environment. However, he raises questions about the longer-term outlook, wondering, ""What does a better rate environment, a normal sloping yield curve, do to people's attention of the fundamentals of commercial real estate?"" describing this as ""the next leg of opportunity"" for the sector. Anderson points out that uncertainty within the 10-year yield curve affects REITs' ability to deploy capital and grow earnings. He emphasizes, ""The real thing that we're watching is the longer end of the curve. And if we get some certainty there, then it's perhaps off to the races, and perhaps we'll have an outperformance here in 2024 from the REITs.""

From Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) scaling back its sports media rights to the MLB Players Association bracing for another lockout, the financial landscape of professional sports continues to shift. Plus, the Caitlin Clark effect continues as the Chicago Sky moves its matchups against the Indiana Fever to a larger venue to accommodate for an increase in fan attendance. Here's what you need to know: Warner Bros. Discovery cuts back on sports Following their fourth quarter earnings call, Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav told investors WBD will be prioritizing intellectual property (IP) from film and TV properties that the company can own versus sports media rights. Zaslav said, “We don’t need any more sports anywhere in the world in order to support our business.” Though WBD will be losing the NBA after this season when their media rights deal ends, the company still owns the rights to the NHL, tennis French Open, NASCAR, Unrivaled women’s basketball league, and All Elite Wrestling. MLB Players Association expects lockout in next round of CBA negotiations The MLB is currently in the midst of collective bargaining negotiations for 2026 and the union is anticipating an offseason lockout. The last time the league faced a lockout was in 2021 and it delayed the 2022 season by a week. MLBPA Executive Director Tony Clark says 2026 CBA negotiations will start this coming spring and if a new CBA is not signed by December 1, the MLB will likely enter a lockout. Chicago Sky moves Caitlin Clark & Indiana Fever games to the United Center It’s the Caitlin Clark effect all over again. Chicago Sky announced they will be moving their two home games against the Indiana Fever from the Wintrust Arena to the United Center. This move will allow for 10,000 more tickets to be sold for each of these games, as the United Center has almost twice the capacity of Wintrust Arena. Plus, Carrick Rangers F.C. Owner Michael W.
